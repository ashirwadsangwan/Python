# Object Oriented Programming

Python is an object-oriented programming language. That means it provides features that support object-oriented programming (OOP).

Object-oriented programming has its roots in the 1960s, but it wasnâ€™t until the mid 1980s that it became the main programming paradigm used in the creation of new software. It was developed as a way to handle the rapidly increasing size and complexity of software systems and to make it easier to modify these large and complex systems over time.

Up to now, some of the programs we have been writing use a procedural programming paradigm. In procedural programming the focus is on writing functions or procedures which operate on data. In object-oriented programming the focus is on the creation of objects which contain both data and functionality together. Usually, each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in the real world and the functions that operate on that object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact.

In Python, every value is actually an object. Whether it be a dictionary, a list, or even an integer, they are all objects. Programs manipulate those objects either by performing computation with them or by asking them to perform methods. To be more specific, we say that an object has a **state** and a collection of **methods** that it can perform. (More about methods below.) The state of an object represents those things that the object knows about itself. The state is stored in **instance variables**.
